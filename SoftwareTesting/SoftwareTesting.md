# Software Testing

## Software Testing Context
1. How deterministic is the project
> - Do you know exactly what the program needs to do at the start?
2. What is the organizational relationship of testers to the developers?
> - Is it as an agile team or as a seperate tester for release?
3. What is the technical nature of the project

## Test Strategy
Choices and reasoning towards choosing a testing method.
Must take context into account during testing.
Takes the mission of testing 
- Is it important to make it usable first?
- Or is it to find new bugs that are inside the program?

### The dimension of testing technique
1. **Testers** : Who is testing it?
2. **Coverage** : What is tested?
3. **Potential Problems** : Why are you testing it? What could come up?
4. **Activities** : How are you testing it?
5. **Evaluation** : How are the results detemined?
Using these will help you find the right techniques and gaps in testing strategy

### Agile Testing Quadrant

### Black Box Testing VS White Box Testing
- Black Box -> Knowledge of how the system is built but does not inform the testing
- White Box -> Knowledge of how the ststem is built and informs the testing or even the object of the tests
